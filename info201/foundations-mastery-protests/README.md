# Assignment 1: Protests
The past few years in the United States, there has been a surge in protests in support of Black Lives Matter, gender equity, and other social issues. In this assignment, you'll work with data from [CountLove](https://countlove.org/) -- the same data often [cited](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/28/us/black-lives-matter-protest.html) by the New York Times -- to learn more about demonstrations over the past few years. 

By completing the assignment, you will demonstrate the following skills:

- Use of **version control** for managing your code
- Declaring document rendering using **markdown** syntax
- Foundational programming skills in R. 


## Background Research
Before diving into this (or any) dataset, it's important to have _domain familiarity_ (i.e., to know something about the topic). As preparation, I'm asking that you read **three articles** about protests in the U.S., and provide a brief 1 - 2 sentence summary or takeaway from each one. 

In the section below, create an **unordered list** of the three articles you found. Make sure to provide an appropriate markdown link (_not_ just the URL) to the article in addition to your 1 - 2 sentence summary. 

- https://www.columbian.com/news/2020/jul/22/driver-accused-of-hitting-2-protesters-pleads-not-guilty/

A man accused of driving a car on to a closed Seattle freeway this month and hitting two protesters, **killing** one and seriously injuring the other, pleaded not guilty. Seattle has been the site of prolonged unrest following the May police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which sparked nationwide protests.

- https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-police-arrests-16-at-capitol-hill-protest-on-saturday/

Sixteen protesters were arrested on Capitol Hill on Saturday night after some in the group shattered windows at a Starbucks on East Olive Way and threw what appeared to be fireworks into the store.

- https://komonews.com/news/local/woman-says-she-shot-man-at-uw-protest-to-prevent-stabbing

A woman who **shot** a man during protests of a right-wing speaker at the University of Washington says she fired to stop her husband from getting stabbed.

## Accompanying Image 
In this section, please **display one image** to accompany your text, and describe _why_ you included it (~2 - 3 sentences). This will require that you download an image into your project folder. In your description, use **bold** and _italics_ (at least once, for practice) to emphasize some of your points. 

![protestor in Seattle](Racial_Injustice_Seattle_15944.jpg-2d0c5.jpg)

I chose this picture because I felt so **bad** for the woman protesting. Moreover, It was scary to see the police to see the police _indiscriminately_ killing a lot of people.

## Analysis
At this point, you should open up your `analysis.R` script to begin working with the data. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data. Throughout the script, there are prompts labeled **Reflection**. Please write 1 - 2 sentences for each of these reflections below:

- What does the difference between the mean and the median tell you about the *distribution* of the data?

The difference between the mean and the median is big, which means that the distribution of the data is wide.

- Does the number of protests in Washington surprise you? Why or why not?

It made me surprised because all people looked aggressive and killed one another. 

- Looking at the `state_table` variable, what data quality issues do you notice, and how would you use that to change your analysis (no need to actually change your analysis)?

I can notice the state name and the frequency of them, and I think there is no changeg in my analysis after I read this variable.

- Does the change in the number of protests from 2019 to 2020 surprise you? Why or why not?

I did not surprised because the ratio does not have a big difference as I expected.

- Do a bit of research. Find at least *two specific policies* that have been changed as a result of protests in 2020. These may be at the city, state, or University level. Please provide a basic summary, as well as a link to each article.

https://www.businessinsider.com/13-concrete-changes-sparked-by-george-floyd-protests-so-far-2020-6
Editors have resigned, statues have toppled, and police reforms have been announced in several cities across the US.

- Take a look (`View()`) your `high_level_table` variable. What picture does this paint of the U.S.?

There are lots of protest related to civil rights and imigration.

## Critical Reflection
Now that you have had time to work with the data and visualize it, I want you to practice thinking critically about the dataset we provided. An important part of data analysis is reflecting on the assumptions, limitations, and gaps in your datasets. Remember that all datasets have to make assumptions and not all assumptions are bad or unreasonable! Practicing these skill will help you in your career to be self critical and ethically alert.

For this section, please write 2-3 sentences for each of the reflections below:

- How was the dataset collected and who collected the data? 

When people use the internet and record their knowledge, dataset can be collected. Survey, interview, or some articles and writings can be a source of collecting data. I believe that people have always been collecting data in our daily lives.

- What assumptions does the dataset make? List at least two assumptions you identified. For inspiration, check out this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/check-your-assumptions-about-your-data-20be250c143) that describes one method for identifying data assumptions.   

By making assumptions with dataset, we can predict the future and prepare for it such as weather forecast. After I analysis the dataset, I can assume there can be lots of protests in the future as well as people need to be aware of some violence and pursue peace protests.

- What data is missing from the dataset? Think about if there are any data points you would have liked to have seen in the dataset. 

Protests in the past have been mostly violent. However, there may have been nonviolent protests in recent times. I thought it would have been nice to indicate whether the protests were violent or not.

## Final Thoughts
When you are finished, with your analysis, please answer the following questions in 1-2 sentences each. 

- What about the analysis surprised you?

It was surprising that complex data could be sorted out at once with just a few codes and functions. 

- What parts of this analysis did you find challenging?

Making function is the hardest part. Unlike using a function that has been created, it was too complicated to create your own code.

- What types of analysis do you wish you were able to do with the dataset, but currently don't have the technical skills to do?

I am not sure whether technical skills already exist or not, but I would like to distinguish the sources and categorize them.
